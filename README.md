# DataMining
Data Mining Project Phase 3
Apply data mining algorithms to solve the defined problem and evaluate model performance.

This code accomplished the following:


Model Selection: Select appropriate algorithms (e.g., decision tree, k-NN) based on the type of problem (classification, regression, clustering). Model Training: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets, then train the model and make predictions. Model evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score (for classification), R-squared, and RMSE (for regression). Submission: Please submit the model evaluation results, including visualization.
